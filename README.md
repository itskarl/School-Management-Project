### DESCRIPTION
Welcome to Animal Farm Academy! This project is a demonstration of object-oriented programming in a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

Assignment: To design and create an administrative panel for a school. The panel should create a relational database amongst instructors, students, courses, cohorts and means to create, edit, and delete them.

### DESIGN
This panel was designed to look and feel like a sleek, clean desktop application in your browser. The navigation was built in a dashboard format for simplicity of use. Icons were sourced from flaticon.com

### LANGUAGES USED
Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX

### FEATURES


- Showcases dynamic animation on landing page as a point of interest. Animation built on vanilla Javascript and CSS
- Designed with very user-friendly interface and visually appealing graphics
- While there is a way for users to be created, access levels have not yet been set up. But, object models are designed to allow for an easy transition to a panel with different access privileges for students and teachers.
